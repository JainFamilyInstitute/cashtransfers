They use data from the Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth to assess the mental health and well-being in children. They find that an increase in unearned household income led to large positive effects on children’s emotional and behavioral health and positive personality trait development, especially amongst children who did not do as well as their peers in these aspects prior to the treatment. They also find that improved parental behavior and familial relationships was likely to be an important channel via which financial well-being may impact child development.

the Discourse on Antipoverty Policy: Reconsidering a Negative Income Tax. Journal of Poverty. 2015. ","Wiederspan et al argue that a negative income tax can help fill the gaps in current federal means-tested assistance programs which tend not to be sufficiently large and far-reaching. While past NIT experiments have led to a reduction in labor supply, the effects were not as large as often speculated, and time saved from work was spent on childcare and looking for work. Moreover, those experiments do not measure long-term, general equilibrium effects. They then show that an NIT can be funded using expenditure from existing programs which it potentially replaces, and if the marginal tax rate was chosen carefully. Finally, they assert that a NIT can be made more politically appeasing by appealing to the fact that it coheres with people’s values rather than focusing on the technical policy details, as well as by highlighting the economic and social costs of poverty to society.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10875549.2014.991889,,,,,,Presenting the case for implementing a negative income tax - some arguments are applicable to a UBI,Y,,,,,,,

December 2017.","Walker (2017) estimates the effect of exogenous positive income shocks to household income in Kenya on informal taxes and provision of public goods. Using surveys of village leaders, and panel and experimental household data from a sample of participants who received a large one-time unconditional cash transfer in GiveDirectly’s RCT, Walker estimates regression models at household, village and sub-location level and reports no  significant  effects  on  the  amount  paid  in  formal  taxes,  and in the  informal  tax  rate. He notes a 2.4 percentage point increase in county  tax  payment  which he relates to the fact that  recipient  households  are  more  likely  to  be  self-employed. There is also no attributable effect on public goods provision or the quality of public good provision, indicating no short run effects of the income changes on public good provision or informal taxation systems that can be attributable to the exogenous income shock.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/cwh8v1o1hjo4isb/Walker_Taxation_UCTs_Kenya.pdf?dl=0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. 2013.","Taylor et al examine the general equilibrium effects of a cash transfer for orphans and vulnerable children (CT-OVC) in Kenya. Using four administrative and private data sources, they simulate the estimates of income multipliers and highlight significant spillover effects of the CT-OVC transfers in local economies. Local income multipliers are significantly greater than 1 in nominal terms, even when capital and labor constraints limit the local supply response. They note most of the effects are among ineligible households, indicating that the programme enables them to access more capital and labor to increase their production to respond to increased local demand. They note variations in impacts across regions in the income multiplier, and highlight differences in capital, liquidity and labor market constraints.",http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/p2p/Publications/Kenya_LEWIE_2013.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Policy Report. 2011","In their evidence paper, DfID reports that there is substantial evidence to show that cash transfers can reduce inquality, boost movement out of poverty for working age populations, and has led to sizable gains in access to health and education indicators, but have had lesser success in the final outcomes from these two sectors.They also report indicative and deterministic factors that indiciate that cash transfers can improve household productivity, income generation, female equality, empowerment of the poor and local market development. They also report that there is little evidence of negative labor market effects and negative effects on fertility.  While there is limited evidence on aggregate growth, they indicate that cash transfers can lead to long term growth through improvements in human capital.

"Ravaillon, Martin. Guaranteed Employment or Guaranteed Income? Working Paper 482. Center for Global Development. 2018.","Ravaillon critically reviews the two rights-based policies of guaranteed income and guaranteed work from a policy perspective. With a specific case study of India to highlight constraints and challenges in implementing these policies in developing countrie, Ravaillon argues that issues of cost, targetting, corruption and variations in contexts and settings are only a few of the features which restrict an unequivocal support of either policy. He argues that finely targetting transfers like UCTs and CCTs and untargeted universal transfers like UBI may be preferrable in different settings, but policies which don't target too finely may be more cost-effective in combatting poverty in some settings.

Jacob Bastian and Katherine Michelmore. The Long-Term Impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Children’s Education and Employment Outcomes. Journal of Labor Economics. July 2018.,"Bastian and Michelmore examine the long-run impact of an EITC on children who were exposed to EITC variations by using EITC exposure as an instrument for family income. They used data from the 1968 to 2013 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics which captures four decades of variation in EITC. They find that an exogenous shock in income induced by a change in EITC policy increase educational attainment and employment in adulthood, and this is done through increasing pre-tax income. Their reduced-form estimate suggest that an increase of $1000 in EITC exposure increases high school graduation and college graduation by 1.3% and 4.2% respectively for children exposed to the increase when they were between the ages of 13 to 18. It also raises the probability of them being employed by 1.0%. However, EITC exposure had no significant effects on children below the age of 13 conditional upon later exposure.",https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697477,U.S.A.,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y

However, for families with two or less children, the maximum credit distributed to them has remained the same in inflation-adjusted terms since 1996. As such, Hoynes et al propose to increase the EITC credit by 10% while maintaining its current structure so as to increase wages which have been stagnating, increase employment further and bring about 600,000 people out of poverty.",http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/making_work_pay_expanded_eitc_Hoynes_Rothstein_Ruffini.pdf,U.S.A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y

Lead to Sustainable Poverty Reduction? Evidence from two government-led programmes in
Zambia. Innocenti Working Paper 2016-21, UNICEF Office of Research, Florence. 2016.","From 2010 to 2011, the Zambian government launched two unconditional cash transfer pilot programmes. The Child Grant Program (CGP) targeted all households with a child whose age is under three in year 2011 in three poor rural districts, and the Multiple Category Targeted Programme (MCP) was implemented in two rural districts and targeted households with a female or elderly head keeping orphans, or a disabled member, or deemed to be critically vulnerable otherwise. Bimonthly transfers were made to each household irrespective of size, and this entailed a transfer of USD 24 per month in Purchasing Power Parity terms. ITT estimates made 24 months and 36 months into the study in nine domains, namely total consumption, food security, asset holdings, subjective well-being (relative poverty), income and revenues, finance and debt, material needs, schooling and young child anthropometry, show that that both the CGP and the MCP had statistically significant effects in almost all domains except for schooling and young child anthropometry for the CGP, and incomes and revenues after 24 months for the MCP (effects on young child nutrition were not measured for the MCP). A sizeable multiplier effect is observed given that households spent 59 per cent more than the value of the transfer.",https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/IWP_2016_21.pdf,Zambia,,,Zambia,,,Y,,Y,Y,,,,
