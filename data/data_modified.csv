"Hoynes, H., Rothstein, J., & Ruffini, K. (2017). Making Work Pay Better Through an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit. Driving Growth through Women’s Economic Participation, 57.","The EITC has been found to reduce poverty rates as well as improve health and education outcomes. However, for families with two or fewer children, the maximum credit distributed to them has remained the same in inflation-adjusted terms since 1996. As such, Hoynes et al (2017) propose to increase the EITC credit by 10% while maintaining its current structure so as to increase wages which have been stagnating, further increase employment, and bring about 600,000 people out of poverty.

"Handa, S., Natali, L., Seidenfeld, D., Tembo, G., & Davis, B. (2016). Can unconditional cash transfers lead to sustainable poverty reduction? Evidence from two government-led programmes in Zambia (No. inwopa858).","Between 2010 and 2011, the Zambian government launched two unconditional cash transfer pilot programmes, described in this 2016 paper from Handa et al. The Child Grant Program (CGP) targeted all households with a child under three years old in three poor rural districts, while the Multiple Category Targeted Programme (MCP) was implemented in two rural districts and targeted vulnerable households such as those with a disabled family member, or those with a female or elderly head caring for orphans. Bimonthly transfers were made to each household irrespective of size, and this entailed a transfer of USD 24 per month in Purchasing Power Parity terms. ITT estimates made 24 months and 36 months into the study in nine domains, namely total consumption, food security, asset holdings, subjective well-being (relative poverty), income and revenues, finance and debt, material needs, schooling and young child anthropometry, show that that both the CGP and the MCP had statistically significant effects in almost all domains except for schooling and young child anthropometry for the CGP, and incomes and revenues after 24 months for the MCP (effects on young child nutrition were not measured for the MCP). A sizeable multiplier effect is observed given that households spent 59% more than the value of the transfer.
